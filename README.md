## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I started to refactor my code using `@extend`. It helped me spot different repeating parts.

### Continued development

It would be good to use parts for the next projects, seperate the styles into different files; reset, typography, component, ...
